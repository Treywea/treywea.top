Summary: In summary, we added more extensive multiomic datasets than the current soybean websites and developed unique functionalities like primer design and universal sequence retrieval to greatly minimize biologists efforts while studying gene regulation. All of these features work together to make Wildsoydb DataHub a user-centric web interface for accessing soybean genomes and genomic resources from multiple high-quality references. We believe it will be an efficient platform for biologists and breeders and accelerate their studies.
