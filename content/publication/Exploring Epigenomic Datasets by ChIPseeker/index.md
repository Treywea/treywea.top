Summary: In many aspects of life, epigenetics, or the altering of phenotype without changes in sequences, play an essential role in biological function. A vast num- ber of epigenomic datasets are emerging as a result of the advent of next- generation sequencing. Annotation, comparison, visualization, and interpre- tation of epigenomic datasets remain key aspects of computational biology. ChIPseeker is a Bioconductor package for performing these analyses among variable epigenomic datasets. The fundamental functions of ChIPseeker, in- cluding data preparation, annotation, comparison, and visualization, are ex- plained in this article. ChIPseeker is a freely available open-source pack- age that may be found at https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/ChIPseeker.
