abstract = {ChIP-seq is widely used for mapping the transcription factor (TF) binding sites throughout the genome in vivo. In this study, we adopted and modified ChIPmentation, a fast, robust, low-input requirement ChIP-seq method, to a transient expression system using soybean protoplasts to expedite the exploration of TF binding sites. To test this new protocol, we expressed a tagged version of a C2H2-type zinc finger TF, JAGGED1 (GmJAG1), in soybean protoplasts and successfully identified its binding sites in the soybean genome. Furthermore, valuable genomic features such as a novel GmJAG1-binding motif, and the epigenetic characteristics as well as an enhancer-like function of GmJBSs were also found via coupling ATAC-seq and H3K27me3 ChIP-seq data. The application of the modified ChIPmentation protocol in this study using soybean protoplasts provided a new approach for rapid elucidation of how a TF binds to the various target genes in the soybean genome, as illustrated here using GmJAG1.},

@article{Liu2019,
abstract = {To obtain a comprehensive understanding of transcriptomic reprogramming under salt stress, we performed whole-transcriptome sequencing on the leaf and root of soybean seedlings subjected to salt treatment in a time-course experiment (0, 1, 2, 4, 24, and 48 hr). This time series dataset enabled us to identify important hubs and connections of gene expressions. We highlighted the analysis on phytohormone signaling pathways and their possible crosstalks. Differential expressions were also found among those genes involved in carbon and nitrogen metabolism. In general, the salt-treated seedlings slowed down their photosynthetic functions and ramped up sugar catabolism to provide extra energy for survival. Primary nitrogen assimilation was shut down whereas nitrogen resources were redistributed. Overall, the results from the transcriptomic analyses indicate that the plant uses a multipronged approach to overcome salt stress, with both fast-acting, immediate physiological responses, and longer term reactions that may involve metabolic adjustment.},

@article{Wang2021,
abstract = {Pericentromeric DNA, consisting of high-copy-number tandem repeats and transposable elements, is normally silenced through DNA methylation and histone modifications to maintain chromosomal integrity and stability. Although histone deacetylase 6 (HDA6) has been known to participate in pericentromeric silencing, the mechanism is still yet unclear. Here, using whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-Seq), we mapped the genome-wide patterns of differential DNA methylation and histone H3 lysine 18 acetylation (H3K18ac) in wild-type and hda6 mutant strains. Results show pericentromeric CHG hypomethylation in hda6 mutants was mediated by DNA demethylases, not by DNA methyltransferases as previously thought. DNA demethylases can recognize H3K18ac mark and then be recruited to the chromatin. Using biochemical assays, we found that HDA6 could function as an ‘eraser' enzyme for H3K18ac mark to prevent DNA demethylation. Oxford Nanopore Technology Direct RNA Sequencing (ONT DRS) also revealed that hda6 mutants with H3K18ac accumulation and CHG hypomethylation were shown to have transcriptionally active pericentromeric DNA.},
