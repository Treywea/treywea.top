This phenomenon, called priming, was observed here in soybean (Glycine max) seedlings exposed to salt stress. Time-course transcriptomic profiles revealed distinctively different transcriptional responses in the primed seedlings from those in the non-primed seedlings under high salinity stress, indicating a stress response strategy of repressing unhelpful biotic stress responses and focusing on the promotion of those responses important for salt tolerance. To identify histone marks altered by the priming salinity treatment, a genome-wide profiling of Histone 3 Lysine 4 dimethylation (H3K4me2), Histone 3 Lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3), and Histone 3 Lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9ac) was performed. Our integrative analyses revealed that priming induced drastic alterations in these histone marks, which coordinately modified stress response, ion homeostasis and cell wall modification. Furthermore, transcriptional network analyses unveiled epigenetically modified networks which mediate the strategic downregulation of defense responses. Altering the histone acetylation status using a chemical inhibitor could elicit the priming-like transcriptional responses in non-primed seedlings, confirming the importance of histone marks in forming the priming response.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Priming-induced alterations in histone modifications modulate transcriptional responses in soybean under salt stress","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Qianwen Wang","Xiucong Bao","Shengjie Chen","Huan Zhong","Yaqin Liu","Li Zhang","Yiji Xia","Friedrich Kragler","Ming Luo","Xiang David Li","Hon-Ming Lam","Shoudong Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1627776000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627776000,"objectID":"0e63dacdf3a649204446d3aa6b92b10c","permalink":"https://treywea.top/publication/athda6-functions-as-an-h3k18ac-eraser-to-maintain-pericentromeric-chg-methylation-in-arabidopsis-thaliana/","publishdate":"2021-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/athda6-functions-as-an-h3k18ac-eraser-to-maintain-pericentromeric-chg-methylation-in-arabidopsis-thaliana/","section":"publication","summary":"Pericentromeric DNA, consisting of high-copy-number tandem repeats and transposable elements, is normally silenced through DNA methylation and histone modifications to maintain chromosomal integrity and stability. Although histone deacetylase 6 (HDA6) has been known to participate in pericentromeric silencing, the mechanism is still yet unclear. Here, using whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-Seq), we mapped the genome-wide patterns of differential DNA methylation and histone H3 lysine 18 acetylation (H3K18ac) in wild-type and hda6 mutant strains. Results show pericentromeric CHG hypomethylation in hda6 mutants was mediated by DNA demethylases, not by DNA methyltransferases as previously thought. DNA demethylases can recognize H3K18ac mark and then be recruited to the chromatin. Using biochemical assays, we found that HDA6 could function as an â€˜eraserâ€™ enzyme for H3K18ac mark to prevent DNA demethylation. Oxford Nanopore Technology Direct RNA Sequencing (ONT DRS) also revealed that hda6 mutants with H3K18ac accumulation and CHG hypomethylation were shown to have transcriptionally active pericentromeric DNA.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"AtHDA6 functions as an H3K18ac eraser to maintain pericentromeric CHG methylation in Arabidopsis thaliana","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Qianwen Wang","Wai-Shing Yung","Zhili Wang","Hon-Ming LAM"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1593820800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593820800,"objectID":"4831365c8c0f60c4c58e92b29c136397","permalink":"https://treywea.top/publication/the-histone-modification-h3k4me3-marks-functional-genes-in-soybean-nodules/","publishdate":"2020-07-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/the-histone-modification-h3k4me3-marks-functional-genes-in-soybean-nodules/","section":"publication","summary":"Nitrogen fixation in legumes requires the development of specialized organs called root nodules. Here we characterized the high-confidence transcriptome and genome-wide patterns of H3K4me3 marks in soybean roots and mature nodules symbiotic with Sinorhizobium fredii. Changes in H3K4me3 levels were positively associated with the transcription levels of functional genes in the nodules. The up-regulation of H3K4me3 levels was not only present in leghaemoglobin and nodulin-related genes, but also in genes involved in nitrogen and carbon metabolic pathways. In addition, genes regulating the transmembrane transport of metal ions, phosphates, sulphates, peptides, and sugars were differentially modified. On the contrary, a loss of H3K4me3 marks was found in several key transcription factor genes and was correlated with the down-regulation of the defense- related network in nodules, which could contribute to nodule maintenance. All these findings demonstrate massive reprogramming of gene expressions via alterations in H3K4me3 levels in the genes in mature soybean nodules.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"The histone modification H3K4me3 marks functional genes in soybean nodules","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?
